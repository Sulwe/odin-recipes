    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings 
        such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include 
        ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, 
        such as garlic, oregano and basil.</p>
    <p>The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which 
        becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other 
        ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving
         square portions. </p>
